# Psuedo solution
# cipherset: [ct1, ct2, ct3, ]
# Hintset: set of unique [space xor chars]
# SolutionSet: 

# Ct1 XOR CT2 (equals m1 xor m2) 
#     look for values in hintset
#     // which string is space in vs char?
#     XOR str with other strings , until condition breaks
    
#     place correct string, value in solution set

# Do this 10! times
#     should have enough values to replace sentence. 
#     not needing to know k at all!
